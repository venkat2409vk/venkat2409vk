- âš¡ Fun fact: Did you know? The first computer virus, known as "Creeper," was created in 1971 as an experiment. It displayed the message "I'm the creeper, catch me if you can!" and was designed to move between computers on the ARPANET, which was a precursor to the internet. It wasn't malicious, but it led to the creation of the first antivirus program called "Reaper," which was designed to remove Creeper.
